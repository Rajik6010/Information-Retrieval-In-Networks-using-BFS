# Information-Retrieval-In-Networks-using-BFS
major objective of the project is to find  the shortest path on a network graph through  searching all nodes and edges using Breadth  First Search (BFS). The algorithm, BFS can  be used in P2P Networks, Web Crawlers,  Network Broadcasting, Navigation Systems  and Un-Weighted Graphs. In our scenario,  we pegged our research discussion on P2P  networks in a learning institution. The  learning institution has a departmental computer connected together via a switch,  referred herein as Local Area Networks  (LAN), connection of departments referred  to as Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)  and the provision of/to external connection  to the rest of the world referred herein as  Wide Area Network (WAN).
